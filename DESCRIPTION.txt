\
The name of our game is Alien Defense, a shooting game where player gains scores by controlling the Doodie to shoot enemies. \
\
The initial lives of Doobie is 3 and initial score is 0.\
\
Players need press the direction key or \'91WASD\'92  to move the Doodie. There are three kinds of enemies: small enemies, big enemies and BOSS, whose scores are 100, 300, and 1000 respectively. \
To get a full score, the bullet need shoot once to kill small enemies, 8 times to kill big enemies and 20 times to kill the boss.\
\
The initial difficult level is 1 and as you score more, the level will go up. Specifically, when the score reaches 8000, level increases by 1 and five more big enemies and 10 more big enemies are added, the bullet of Doobie increases as well. When the score reaches 15000,  level increases by 1 and five more big enemies and 10 more big enemies are added, the bullet of Doobie increases and the BOSS appears as well. When the score reach 30000,  level increases by 1, five more big enemies are added and  the bullet of Doobie increases. When the score reach 40000,  level increases by 1, ten more big enemies are added. \
\
The player can click \'91pause\'92 image to pause the game, and click again, players can continue the game. \
\
Once the Doobie collides with any enemies or the bullet of BOSS, the lives of Doobie decreases by 1 and when the lives becomes 0, all the music stops and the score player gets will show on the screen. Then the player can click \'91x\'92 of the screen to quit. \
